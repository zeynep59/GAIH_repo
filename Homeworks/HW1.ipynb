These variables need to preprocess differently. \nwe can use map() or LabelEncoder() functions to handle ordinal categorical variables. Also we can use get_dummies()(from pandas library) function \nto handle nominal categorival variables.\n\n    One-hot encoding: We create ’n’ columns where n is the number of unique values that the nominal variable can take in one-hot encoding.\n\n    Multicollinearity: If we have multicollinearity in our dataset then we won’t be able to use our weight vector to calculate the feature importance. Multicollinearity impacts the interpretability of our model.\n    \n    The quality of data and the useful information that can be derived from it directly affects\nthe ability of our model to learn; therefore, it is extremely important that we preprocess our data before feeding it into our model.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"answer-5\nWe can analyse and explore continues and discrete variables by using some modeling functions like heatmap, pairplot, scatter etc..","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"answer-6\nThe variable type is continuous and the plot type is distribution plot(it can be drawed by using seaborn library and sns.displot command).\nthere can be outlier when the petal with is 0.2cm so this outlier can be dropped from our dataset.\n","metadata":{}}]}
